2.1 Examine typical language scope

- What is the output when you run this program?
1
1
1
1

- How will the output change if static is uncommented?
1
2
3
4
5

- Can you explain this difference?
static keeps the variable alive in the global scope, so when the function is called again, it is not reset to 0,
instead it keeps its previous value.

- How many variables can you identify in this program? For each variable list the line numbers in which it is in scope
param: 2..10
var1: 3..10
var2: 6..7
c: 12..16
argc: 14..15
argv: 14..15
